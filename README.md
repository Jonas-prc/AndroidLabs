Hardly a finished product, have kind of hit a wall with the java aspect of it all. Not sure if I'll be able to recollect myself and try again before deadline. Linear and Grid are fine, but not even sure how to force the debugger to launch those specific layouts as opposed to the main one brought over from lab 1.
